Put your critic hat on and perform a comprehensive review of the whole application like your life depended on it. Don't nitpick on formatting, syntax or little things like that, but try to bite into architecture, structure, performance and clarity. Write your review into a file called REVIEW.md with the following sections: General project structure and organization, backend organization, backend logic, backend performance, backend security, frontend organization, frontend logic, frontend performance, styling standards. Each section should contain the problem points that you think are worth mentioning, and the suggested fixes / improvements. At the end of the document write a clearly organized task list that details each step along the way to the fully refactored, cleaned up and improved application. Before you start, ask me a few questions that help you do your review job better that I might have overlooked or missed.
